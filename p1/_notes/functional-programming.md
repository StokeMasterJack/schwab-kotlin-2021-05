# functional-programming (+ OOP)

## What

1. Use only vals (no vars)
   IOW: all state is immutable

1. function should:
   a. return a value based solely on function args (and immutable object state)
   b. NOT mutate vars
   
1. functions should have no side effects

1.   a function that have no side effects and returns a value

## Why is FP (expressions) good 

1.  if expr: a small amount of code savings
2.  functional code is more predictable 
2.  functional code is easier to test
2.  More reliable in a server (multi-threaded) environment


Expressions: just compute a value


## Pure Function
The Function's output (Function's return value)  is strictly based the  Function's inputs (Function's args)
