# testValueName DoOnYourOwn


Assignment: Update the bj.Card class such that "bj.CardTest.testValueName()" unit test method compiles and passes

Time: 12:00 to 1:30: to complete the DoOnYourOwn and have lunch break

- Note 1: No need to make any changes to bj.CardTest. The only class you will need to change is bj.Card
- Note 2: The valueName getter will look similar to suitName: String
